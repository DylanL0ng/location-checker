# location-checker
This was something that I made to brush up on my coding skills as 
I have been busy with school and havent had much time to code, 
Im impressed with the turnout nonetheless but I do have to work on my CSS
which is somthing I plan to do in the summer.

PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS WILL NOT WORK ON MOBILE BECAUSE I DIDNT HAVE THE TIME TO MAKE IT RESPONSIVE
